#### Line 1: Importing the I/O Module{id="line-1"}

```ballerina {linenos=table,linenostart=1}
import ballerina/io;
```

Here, we declare the import of the `io` module from the `ballerina` organization. 
- This import allows us to use the `io` module in our code.
- The identifier `io` acts as a prefix, allowing us to reference this module later in the source file.
- The `io` module is essential here, as we'll be using it to print a line to the standard output (STDOUT).

#### Line 2: Formatting the Code{id="line-2"}

```ballerina {linenos=table,linenostart=2}
 
```

This empty line is intentionally added for readability and better formatting. Proper formatting makes our code easy to read and understand.

#### Lines 3 & 8: Defining the Main Function{id="line-3-5"}

```ballerina {linenos=table,linenostart=3}
public function main() {
    // ...
}
```

These lines define the `main` function, which serves as the entry point to the program. 
- We begin with the keyword `function`, followed by the function's name - in this case, `main`.
- The `main` function is required to be public, indicated by the `public` keyword, since it's invoked from outside its module scope (the program runner in this case).
- The function's scope is delineated by open `{` and close `}` braces.

#### Line 4: Printing "Hello, World!"{id="line-4"}

```ballerina {linenos=table,linenostart=4}
    io:println("Hello, World...!");
```

In this line, we're calling the `println` function from the `io` module (recall the [prefix](#line-1) we discussed earlier). 
- The function is invoked using its fully qualified name, with the module prefix `io` followed by `:` and then the function name.
- The argument `"Hello, World...!"` is the string we want to print out to STDOUT.

#### Line 6: Variable Declaration{id="line-6"}

```ballerina {linenos=table,linenostart=6}
    string greeting = "üëãüåè";
```

In this line, we declare a variable named `greeting` of type `string` and assign it the value `"üëãüåè"`.

#### Line 7: Printing the Variable{id="line-7"}

```ballerina {linenos=table,linenostart=7}
    io:println(greeting);
```

In this line, we're calling the `println` function again, this time passing the variable `greeting` as an argument.
