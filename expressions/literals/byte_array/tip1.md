**Usage**

There are two types of Byte Array Literals. Base16 Byte Array Literal and Base64 Byte Array Literal. Additionally, you can use Array Constructor Expression to create a byte array. But instead of writing bytes in textual form, you need to write bytes in decimal form in Array Constructor Expression, which is not convenient for writing long list of bytes.
