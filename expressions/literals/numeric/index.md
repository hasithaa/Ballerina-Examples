# Numeric Literals in Ballerina

* In Ballerina, numeric literals are employed to denote numerical values.
* The programming language supports several numeric types, namely `int`, `float`, and `decimal`.
* Numeric literals in Ballerina can be expressed in two formats:
   - The Decimal system (base 10 format), which is the most commonly used and widely understood numeric system.
   - The Hexadecimal system (base 16 format), useful for representing large numbers or binary data in a more compact form.
