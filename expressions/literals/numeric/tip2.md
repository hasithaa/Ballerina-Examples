**Hexadecimal Numbers**

1. Hexadecimal numbers are denoted by the prefix `0x` or `0X`, followed by hexadecimal digits.
2. The digits in hexadecimal include the decimal digits `0` to `9` and the letters `a` to `f` (or `A` to `F`).
3. The letters `a` to `f` (or `A` to `F`) represent the values ten to fifteen.
4. These digits can be written in either lowercase or uppercase. However, it is recommended to avoid mixing lowercase and uppercase letters within the same number. Consistency in using either all lowercase or all uppercase letters is advised for clarity.
