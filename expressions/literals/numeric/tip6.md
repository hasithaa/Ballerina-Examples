**Working with Scientific Notation**

1. Scientific notation is a method for representing numbers that are either very large or very small.
2. This notation is commonly used in scientific and engineering fields, where numbers can range from extremely large to extremely small.
3. In decimal format, the letters 'e' or 'E' serve as indicators of the exponent. The number following the 'e' or 'E' represents the exponent.
4. This exponent signifies that the decimal point is moved 'n' places to the right (for a positive exponent) or to the left (for a negative exponent).
5. In hexadecimal scientific notation, the letters 'p' or 'P' are used to indicate that the decimal point is shifted 'n' places to the right (for a positive exponent) or to the left (for a negative exponent).
